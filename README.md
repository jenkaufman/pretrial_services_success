# Pretrial Services Success
Statistical analysis of Pretrial Services success rates

***

## Overview
Pretrial Services in Denver Colorado provides supervision for defendants ordered by the Court to supervised conditions of release. Defendants can be released successfully from pretrial supervision once their case is sentenced or dismissed, or if supervision is terminated due to compliance. Defendants can also be released unsuccessfully from pretrial supervision if they fail to appear (FTA) for Court or receive new charges while under pretrial supervision.

This project is to determine whether success rates vary by length of supervision and whether success rates vary by gender.

The data set is from my current employer, City and County of Denver, Department of Public Safety, Community Corrections, and represents all defendants released from pretrial services during calendar years 2018 and 2019.

## Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1
* $H_0$: Pretrial services success and gender are independent.<br>

Hypothesis 2 
* $H_0$: Pretrial services success rates do not vary by length of supervision.<br>
* $H_a$: Pretrial services success rates do vary by length of supervision.<br>
